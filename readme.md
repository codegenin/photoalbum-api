# Sample Photo Album with API. Coded in Laravel

## What is this?

This is a sample photo album application with mobile API. I created this as a sample API for a Ionic training.

## Installation

1. `git clone` and `composer install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Create a blank database
3. Edit `.env` file to point to your database
4. Run `php artisan key:generate`
5. Run `php artisan migrate`. It will also create a test user.
